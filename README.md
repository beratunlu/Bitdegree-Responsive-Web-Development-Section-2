Css Media Queries

I learned the following features in this project.

    A responsive website is a website which responds to the size of the screen of the device viewing that website.
    
    If you need help with different screen sizes, you can write media queries.
    
    Media features require media queries. In order to render the CSS within a media query, you need to meet the conditions of media features.
    
    User’s browser aspects such as screen’s width, height, orientation and resolution can be detected by media features.
    
    When you use the and operator, multiple media features have to be true all at once. 
    
    When you separate the code with a comma (,), only one media feature has to be true.
    
    In order to identify where media queries should be set you can resize the browser and determine where the content naturally breaks. You can make any website look good with the knowledge of media queries and CSS, no matter the screen size - from a small phone to a huge TV.
